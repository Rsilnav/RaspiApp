## Usage
Edit 'test.py' and edit '{absolute_path}/icon.png' to the right path.
Same with 'http://raspi:3000' to the URL of the raspberry pi.
Give execute permissions to both 'test.py' and 'run.sh'.
The first one will keep the console running, the second one will send the application to the background.
